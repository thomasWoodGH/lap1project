# Lap 1 Project - Educational Game

Our project for Lap 1 of LFA, an educational game: 'Roman Grid Game'.

Recommended number of teams: 4-6

Play length: 45 minutes

## Instructions for use

To be played in a classroom, the teacher/host will divvy the class into groups that individually keep track of their score.

Start the server and open client in an internet browser. Click 'Start Game' to begin playing, or 'Rules' to check the rules.

Once play has started, each group will select a square in turns. Each square as a random question underneath from our question API.

Four choices will be available, with one being the correct answer. Correct answers score a range of points; incorrect score 0.

There is a slight chance to receive a power-up when answering a question correctly. The power-ups are explained on the rules page.

The group with the most points after all questions have been selected wins!
