          The ancient Romans left a treasure trove of ideas to the modern world. This legacy included many concepts that
          are still very important even today. Systems of laws and government, architecture, literature, and 
          language are just a few key concepts brought to us by none other than the Ancient Romans.What set the 
          Romans apart from other ancient societies was their ability to take something and make it even better than 
          before. They excelled at this. The Romans could take any idea, copy it, and find a way to do it better than 
          before.

        <h2 class="game-info-title">Why is it helpful in history?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="game-info-para">
          Studying history in Rome is invaluable because of the historical depth embodied by the Eternal City. 
          While reading and learning about various historical periods, students have the opportunity to travel the 
          streets of Rome viewing the monuments and artifacts of the important empire. Rome has a rich, 1,300-year 
          history from kingdom to republic to empire, stretching from the 8th century B.C. to the 5th century A.D.
          This area is major to both for Western civilization and for Christianity, and heavily influences the ideas, 
          philosophies, and concepts that still rule the Western world today.

          Studying the history of Ancient Rome can provide numerous benefits. For instance, it can help us understand the 
          development of political systems, the evolution of language and culture, and the impact of military conquests.
          Additionally, it can help us gain insights into the origins of modern law, architecture, and engineering.As 
          for the behavior patterns in a hostile and competitive environment unrestricted by morals, while there may be 
          instances of this in Ancient Rome, it is important to note that this is not a universal characteristic of the 
          civilization.
